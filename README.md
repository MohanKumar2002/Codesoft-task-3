**Project Title:** Image Captioning AI

**Overview:**
The Image Captioning AI project combines computer vision and natural language processing to generate captions for images. It leverages pre-trained image recognition models like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images. These features are then fed into a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate descriptive captions.

**Features:**
- Integration of computer vision and natural language processing.
- Utilization of pre-trained image recognition models.
- Generation of descriptive captions for images.
- Flexibility to choose between RNN or transformer-based models.

**Implementation:**
1. **Image Feature Extraction:** Utilize pre-trained image recognition models such as VGG or ResNet to extract high-level features from input images.
2. **Text Generation Model:** Implement a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model for generating captions based on the extracted image features.
3. **Training:** Train the text generation model using a dataset of paired images and captions, optimizing it to learn the relationship between image features and their corresponding descriptions.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like BLEU score to assess the quality of generated captions.
5. **Inference:** Deploy the trained model to generate captions for new images in real-time or batch processing.

**Usage:**
1. Provide an image as input to the AI system.
2. The image is processed through the pre-trained image recognition model to extract features.
3. The extracted features are then passed to the text generation model.
4. The model generates a descriptive caption for the image.
5. Repeat the process for multiple images to generate captions.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.x
- Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Pre-trained image recognition models (VGG, ResNet)
- Dataset of paired images and captions for training

**How to Run:**
1. Clone the project repository or download the necessary files.
2. Set up the environment with required dependencies and frameworks.
3. Preprocess the dataset and prepare it for training.
4. Train the text generation model using the provided dataset.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
6. Deploy the trained model for generating captions for new images.

This project serves as an advanced application of AI, enabling computers to generate human-like descriptions of images by combining computer vision and natural language processing techniques.
